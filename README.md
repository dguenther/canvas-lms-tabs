# Canvas Tab Generator

A very simple web interface for creating tabbed content pages for the Canvas learning management system. This is intended for users of Cancas who are not familiar with HTML, but would like to create content pages with tabs. 

## Getting Started

Put the project files in a directory and point a browser to that directory. Or use this one: [https://lincolnlutheran.github.io/canvas-lms-tabs/](https://lincolnlutheran.github.io/canvas-lms-tabs/)

### Notes

HTML for individual tabs can be generated in any manner desired, but it is probably easiest for Canvas users to (1) create the content for each tab as a separate Content Page in Canvas, (2) click on 'HTML Editor' from the edit screen for that page, (3) copy the HTML from there and (4) paste the HTML into the Canvas Tab Generator HTML box.  

This implementation depends on the CSS class enhanceable_content which is included with Canvas, and will not work if that class is removed.
